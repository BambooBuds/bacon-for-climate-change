# bacon-for-climate-change

This a simple ionic app which allows the user to see the effects of their diet on the climate. Each food item is shown corresponding to its kgs of carbon per kg of item. This is then of course translated into how many strips of bacon one could eat instead, and have a better impact on the planet.

Want a double cheesburger? Why not step it up and have a bacon burger? With extra bacon?

## Contributing

To setup the app, all you need to do is:

1 - Install node.js and get yourself familiarized with the npm installer: https://nodejs.org/download/

2 - `sudo npm install -g ionic`, `sudo npm install -g gulp`, `npm install` (run from within the main repo)

3 -
  - For developing: Run `ionic serve` in the main folder of this repo
  - For releasing: Run one of the other ionic build commands (`emulate` etc.)

4 - You'll prolly also need to have `gulp watch` going in another window (also run from within the main repo), but that's only if you're working with sass or the coffeescript.
